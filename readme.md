# Paper Vision: Augmented Reality

**Paper Vision** is an augmented reality (AR) project that transforms traditional paper-based documents into interactive, 3D digital experiences. This project bridges the gap between physical media and the digital world, allowing users to visualize and interact with information in a new way.

## Features

- **Augmented Reality Visualization**: Enhance paper documents with 3D models, animations, and other digital content.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup to overlay AR on existing printed materials.
- **Customizable**: Modify AR content and experiences based on the needs of your project.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with various AR devices and mobile platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: For building interactive AR experiences.
- **Vuforia SDK**: To enable AR functionality through image recognition and tracking.
- **C#**: For scripting and logic implementation.
- **Blender**: For creating 3D models and assets.
